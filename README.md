# clippy_maker_gui.py
Python ffmpeg video clipping GUI because I'm tired of messing up in the command line and "I'm a visual person" who wanted to experience the pain of coding a GUI.

# About üéûÔ∏è
- GUI/front end for ffmpeg-python script to make clips from video files. 
- Uses ```ffmpeg.probe``` to read metadata from the input file and do magic.
- Radiobuttons (in groups) *and* a Slider -- *WOW!*
    - currently ```resolution``` does nothing
- Customizable settings file to save your favorite settings and speed up clipping!
- Output file size estimation to reduce clipping twice to get under 25 MB for sharing on [Discord](https://discord.com/download).
### Recommendations
- To record, [NVIDIA ShadowPlay](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/shadowplay/) works pretty well. [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is another solid option. Honestly, whatever floats your boat (but be mindful of bloaty programs like Overwolf).
- I've found myself really only needing to record the last 30 seconds or so, but I have ShadowPlay set to 75 seconds
    - My ShadowPlay settings: 75 sec, downscale to 720p (from 1440p), 60 fps, bitrate 25 Mbps
        - The bitrate is probably like 2-3x too high but everything looks good to me. Might be a good starting point and then working it down from there.
    - Google is also your friend: this is an article I found [https://riverside.fm/blog/video-bitrate](https://riverside.fm/blog/video-bitrate)

# Installation
- download the file ```clippy_maker_gui.py```  and run it.
- (optional) download ```clip_script_<xxx>.py```, they are the individual scripts---they might need some masssaging to work (read through and make sure you give the inputs correctly).
### Dependencies
- [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter) - *this is part of the python standard lib*
- [RangeSlider](https://pypi.org/project/RangeSlider/)
- [ffmpeg](https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg-python/)
- [vlc](https://pypi.org/project/python-vlc/) - *not needed yet...?*

# To-do List 
- need to make 2-pass/quality method default and 1-pass/fast alternate. 
- improve logic to remove ```update source info``` button
- make ```resolution``` selection do something
- add codecs to ffmpeg probe
    - like .mkv, but it might be similar to .mp4, idk yet
    - and then add buttons to be able to choose? might have too many options or options that conflict? idk yet
- improve ```estimated size calc```
- ```play on complete?``` button, need to make it actually work (either with VLC or explorer)
- Need to improve the workflow...
    - I have pull up the folder, open the file in VLC to find the clipping spots, then come back to the gui. This could be streamlined by embedding the player into the gui to incorporate all in one place. 
- Add optional compiled .exe version (py2exe output) once I'm happier about the state of the program (slimmed down & tuned up).
