# clippy_maker_gui.py
Python ffmpeg video clipping GUI because I'm tired of messing up in the command line and "I'm a visual person" who wanted to experience the pain of coding a GUI.

# About üéûÔ∏è
- GUI/front end for ffmpeg-python script to make clips from video files. 
- Uses ```ffmpeg.probe``` to read metadata from the input file and do magic.
- Radiobuttons and sliders for commonly changed settings for quicker clipping!
- Customizable settings file to save your favorite settings and speed up clipping!
- Output file size estimation to reduce clipping twice to get under 25 MB for sharing on [Discord](discord.com).
### Recommendations
- To record, NVidea ShadowPlay works pretty well. OBS is another solid option.
- I've found myself really only needing to record the last 30 seconds or so, but I have ShadowPlay set to 75 seconds
    - My ShadowPlay settings: 75 sec, downscale to 720p (from 1440p), 60 fps, bitrate 25 Mbps
        - The bitrate is probably like 2-3x too high but everything looks good to me. Might be a good starting point and then working it down from there.
    - Google is also your friend: this is an article I found [https://riverside.fm/blog/video-bitrate](https://riverside.fm/blog/video-bitrate)
